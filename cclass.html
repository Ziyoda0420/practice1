            The Mercedes-Benz C-Class is a series of compact executive cars produced by Mercedes-Benz Group AG. Introduced in 1993 as a replacement for the 190 (W201) range, the C-Class was the smallest model in the marque's line-up until the W168 A-Class arrived in 1997. The C-Class has been available with a "4MATIC" four-wheel drive option since 2002. The third generation (W204) was launched in 2007 while the current W206 generation was launched in 2021.

Initially available in sedan and a station wagon configurations, a fastback coupé (SportCoupé) variant followed and was later renamed to Mercedes-Benz CLC-Class. It remained in production until 2011 when a new W204 C-Class coupé replaced it for the 2012 model year.
